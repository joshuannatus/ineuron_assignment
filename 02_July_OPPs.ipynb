    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Inheritance is the act or a concept in OOP that allows a newly created class (which is mostly referred to as sub class or child class) to take on or inherit properties and methods of another class which most times is referred to as a super class or parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is used in programming especially in OOP to produce resuable codes and reduce writing long and repeated blocks of code, so instead of recreating an properties that exit in a different class orignally created long ago, applying inheritance to the new class can help recreating the entire code without writing plenty lines of code. Imagine creating a \"Vehicle\" class and later on create a \"Car\" class there is a huge possiblity that some block of code in the Vehicle class might be needed in the newly created car class, applying inheritance help reduce the redundacy in rewriting the entire block code in vehicle class that relates to car class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is also used because it affords the program the ability to take on different forms based on the context in the new class, affording flexibility and dynamic behaviour. \n"

    "## Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single Inheritance is when a child class or newly created class inherits or takes on some or all the properties of one parent class or super class. This means that the child class can only take the properties of just one parent class, the inheritance is just from one parent class.\n",
    "### Advantage: \n",
    "Aside the obvious benefits discussed in question 1 as related to inheritance single inheritance allows for the following:\n",
    "* Single inheritance are simple to write and simple to understand, it simple and clear\n",
    "* Single Iheritance are easy to maintain\n",
    "* Single Inheritance as less Ambiguious, because they are clear and follow a simple heriachy \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "This on the other hand is when a child class or newly created class inherits from more than one parent. For example you can have a class for \"vehicles\" and then have a class for \"People\" and you created another class \"people and there varying kind of vechicle- class PeopleRide\", there is a need for the newly created PeopleRide to inherit properties and attributes from the class Vehicles and the class People.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "* Multiple inheritance allows for more reduction of redundant code, so there is a lot of code reuseablilty in multiple inheritance\n",
    "* It gives room from more flexibility, so you can have a child create with varying and dynamic attributes \n",
    "* It also use for modelling or display complex relationship that will require a lot of coding\n",
